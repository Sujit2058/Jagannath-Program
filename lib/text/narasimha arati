Namaste Narasimhaya
Prahladahlada-dayine
Hiranyakasipor Vakshahsila-
Shila-tanka-nakhalaye

Ito Nrisimhah Parato Nrisimho
Yato Yato Yami Tato Nrisimhah

Bahir Nrisimho Hridaye Nrisimho
Nrisimham Adim Saranam Prapadye

Tava Kara-kamala-vare Nakham 
Adbhuta-sringam Dalita-
hiranyakasipu-tanu-bhringam
Kesava Dhrita-narahari-rupa 
Jaya Jagadisa Hare ред

I offer my obeisances to Lord Narasimha who gives joy to Prahlada Maharaja and whose nails are like chisels on the stonelike chest of the demon Hiranyakasipu. 

  Lord Nrisimha is here and also there. Wherever I go Lord Nrisimha is there. He is in the heart and is outside as well. I surrender to Lord Nrisimha, the origin of all things and the supreme refuge. Prayer to Lord Nrisimha by Jayadeva Gosvami
